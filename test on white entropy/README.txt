Please, put them in a new folder, adjust the input file name and the range
(we have here 15 files) and let the latest Fourier transform run over them.
If errors occur let me know. The signals should give approximately the ln(N)
of the number of symbols. Thus, N=24=1*2*3*4 we have ln(24) = 3.17805383035
Variances over different probes should be minimal because they are all the
same. The Fourier spectra should be completely flat (having no specific
peaks) the amplitude spectra should be flat as well.
